\title{Reduce the ploidy of an object of class \code{'genalex'}}
\usage{
\method{reducePloidy}{genalex}(x, new.ploidy = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An annotated data frame of class \code{'genalex'}}

\item{new.ploidy}{The desired new ploidy.  Currently, the only usefully
                  accepted value is 1, with ploidy of \code{x} being 2;
                  a ploidy matching the current ploidy of \code{x}
                  silently returns \code{x}.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments, currently ignored}
}
\value{
A data frame of class \code{'genalex'} containing genotype data
from \code{x} reduced to the specified \code{new.ploidy}, with
attributes updated as required.
}
\description{
Reduce the ploidy of an object of class \code{'genalex'}.
Currently restricted to reducing the ploidy of diploid data to haploid by
selecting only the first allele of each locus.
}
\details{
This function reduced the ploidy of a data frame of class \code{'genalex'}
data frame by selecting the first allele of each locus.  Occasionally
haploid data is encoded in GenAlEx datasets by using homozygous diploid
loci, and this is a useful function for making these truly haploid.
