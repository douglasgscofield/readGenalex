\title{Check for potential null (non-amplifying) alleles}
\usage{
checkNullAlleles(ref, check, mode = c("locus", "column"), quiet = FALSE,
  sep = "\\t", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref}{Object of class \code{'genalex'} containing reference
              genotypes}

\item{check}{Object of class \code{'genalex'} containing genotypes to
              check against \code{ref} for possible null alleles}

\item{mode}{\code{"locus"} or \code{"column"}.  Determines
              containing a potential null allele is indicated in the second
              index of each element of the return value.  If \code{"locus"},
              the value is the locus index, starting from \code{1}.
              If \code{"column"}, then the value is the column index within
              the class \code{'genalex'} data frame.}

\item{quiet}{Logical.  If \code{FALSE}, then messages
              are printed during the check for null alleles in
              \code{check}, and the matrix of potential null allele
              positions is returned invisibly.  If \code{TRUE}, then no
              messages or genotypes are printed, and the matrix of
              potential null allele positions is returned visibly.}

\item{sep}{Separator between loci in output, passed to
              \code{\link{printGenotype}}}

\item{\dots}{Additional parameters passed to \code{\link{printGenotype}}}
}
\value{
A matrix referencing positions within \code{check} that contain
        potential, with its specific format dependent upon the value of
        \code{mode}:
        \itemize{
          \item \code{"locus"}: a logical matrix having dimensions
                \code{(attr(check,"n.samples"),attr(check,"n.loci"))}
                and dimnames
                \code{list(check[,1],attr(check,"locus.names"))} with
                \code{TRUE} for each locus in \code{check} that might
                contain a potential null allele
          \item \code{"column"}: an integer matrix having dimensions
                \code{dim(check)} and dimnames \code{dimnames(check))}
                with nonzero values for each position within \code{check}
                that might contain a potential null allele
        }
        If \code{quiet = FALSE}, this value is returned invisibly.

If \code{quiet = FALSE} (the default), output is also written in the
form of two messages indicating the number of reference and check
genotypes, as well as a listing of specific check and matching reference
genotypes with the loci containing the potential null alleles called out.
The check and reference genotypes are printed together with a label
equal to the respective argument names to indicate their origins.  This
listing is produced using \code{printGenotype}, and arguments can be
passed through to modify its  output.
}
\description{
Check genotypes against a set of reference genotypes and look for
loci that differ in a way consistent with the occurrence of a null
allele, that is, heterozygous in the reference and homozygous matching
one of the alleles in the heterozygous reference.  A report of genotypes
with potential null is generated, unless \code{quiet = TRUE}, and
a matrix is returned indicating the positions of potential null alleles
within the check genotypes.  The configuration of this matrix depends
on the \code{mode} argument.
}
\note{
The reference genotypes are assumed to be genotyped correctly,
       without null alleles of their own.  The check for null alleles is
       only as complete as the set of reference genotypes.

Only genotypes with ploidy of 2 are currently supported.
